# Refactor Browser Service to Use Bun.$ Shell Syntax

## Overview
Refactor the browser service in `/apps/cli/src/services/browser/browser.ts` to use Bun's dollar sign template literal syntax (`Bun.$`) instead of `Bun.spawn` for executing shell commands.

## Current Implementation
The current implementation uses `Bun.spawn` to execute platform-specific commands to open URLs in the default browser. It handles:
- Platform detection (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Error handling with Result types
- Process exit code checking
- Stderr capture for error messages

## Proposed Changes
Replace the `Bun.spawn` approach with Bun's shell template literal syntax for cleaner, more readable code.

## Todo Items
- [ ] Import the `$` function from "bun"
- [ ] Replace the spawn-based implementation with `$` template literals
- [ ] Maintain the same error handling behavior with Result types
- [ ] Handle platform-specific commands (open, xdg-open, cmd)
- [ ] Ensure Windows special handling is preserved
- [ ] Test on available platforms

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes
1. Import `$` from "bun" instead of `spawn`
2. Use template literals with `$` for command execution
3. Simplify the command execution logic
4. Maintain the same error handling and Result type patterns

### Platform-Specific Commands
- **macOS**: `open <url>`
- **Linux**: `xdg-open <url>`
- **Windows**: `cmd /c start "" <url>`

### Error Handling
The refactored code should:
- Catch any errors from the shell command execution
- Return appropriate BrowserServiceErr with context
- Maintain the same Result<void> return type

## Benefits
- Cleaner, more readable syntax
- Less boilerplate code
- Native shell integration
- Better alignment with Bun's recommended patterns

## Review

### Summary of Changes

1. **Browser Service**: Successfully refactored to use Bun.$ syntax
   - Replaced `spawn` with `$` for simple command execution
   - Reduced code from ~20 lines to ~3 lines for command execution
   - Maintained all error handling with Result types

2. **Tunnel Services**: Mixed approach based on requirements
   - **Cloudflare**: Kept using `Bun.spawn` due to need for real-time stderr streaming
   - **Ngrok**: Used `$` for version check, kept `spawn` for tunnel startup (stdout streaming)
   - Both services maintain their streaming output parsing capabilities

3. **Key Learnings**:
   - Bun.$ is excellent for simple command execution (like browser opening)
   - For long-running processes with stream parsing, Bun.spawn is still necessary
   - The $ syntax dramatically reduces boilerplate for fire-and-forget commands

4. **Test Results**: All services tested and working correctly
   - Browser service opens URLs successfully
   - Cloudflare tunnel captures URLs from stderr stream
   - Ngrok tunnel parses JSON logs from stdout stream

### Code Quality Improvements
- Removed ~50% of boilerplate code in browser service
- Improved readability with template literal syntax
- Maintained type safety throughout refactoring
- All existing functionality preserved
