# Epicenter: A Database for Your Mind, Built on Plain Text

Epicenter is an open-source, local-first ecosystem for writers, builders, and privacy enthusiasts. It stores all your work‚Äînotes, transcripts, chat histories‚Äîin a single folder of plain text. Every tool we build shares this memory: your text editor, personal assistant, etc.. It's open, tweakable, and yours. Grep it, open it in Obsidian, host it wherever you like. The choice is yours.

Our vision is to build a personal workspace where you own your data, choose your models, and replace siloed apps with open, interoperable alternatives. All while preserving authenticity and being free and open source. ‚ù§Ô∏è



## How It Works

All Epicenter tools share a single memory: **a plain-text folder on your machine**. 

Open it in any editor. Grep it. Sync it. Host it wherever you like. Your data is never locked in.

In a world where every app wants to trap you and your data, we're building the opposite.

## Current Tools

### ü§ñ [epicenter.sh](./apps/sh)
A local-first assistant you can chat with. It lives in your folder, and we want to make it the access point to everything you've ever written, thought, or built. Your second brain becomes your dialogue partner.

### üéôÔ∏è [Whispering](./apps/whispering)
Press shortcut ‚Üí speak ‚Üí get text. A desktop transcription app that cuts out the middleman (bring your own API key).

We eventually will enable transcription to feed directly into your shared memory.

### üõ†Ô∏è [Epicenter CLI](./apps/cli)
The command-line glue that connects everything. Smart defaults, automatic configuration, built for hackers.

## Where We're Headed

A growing software ecosystem‚Äîtext editor, personal CRM, and more‚Äîall built around your shared local memory. Tools for people who read, write, build, and connect.

A renaissance workflow, built on plain text and real ownership.

## Join Us

**We're looking for contributors.**

If you're passionate about open source, local-first software, or are just a cracked Svelte/TypeScript developer‚Äîwe'd love to build with you.

If you think like a generalist, build like a hacker, and value tools that respect your mind:

## About Me

At 18, I taught myself to code while studying ethics, politics, and economics at Yale. Since then, I've averaged ~10k commits/year and worked at three YC startups. I wrote my 65-page senior thesis on open-source governance and digital platforms.

I care deeply about data ownership, open-source, and interdisciplinary thinking. I want this project to reflect that.
