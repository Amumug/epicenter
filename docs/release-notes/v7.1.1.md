## v7.1.1 - Reworking Paste Functionality

This release resolves a bug where paste functionality was slow, unreliable, or broken, as reported in issues like #472. The paste mechanism has been reworked to simulate a native Command/Control + V keystroke instead of relying on the previous `enigo.text` function. Please note that this presumes a QWERTY keyboard layout (please create an issue if you are using another keyboard layout)!

This provides a significantly more reliable pasting experience. Thank you to @shanelindsay for implementing this fix in #509.
