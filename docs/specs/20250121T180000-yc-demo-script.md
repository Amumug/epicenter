# YC Live Demo Guide: Epicenter (2 minutes)

## The Hook (15 seconds)
"I have 847 markdown files on my computer. Meeting notes, code snippets, random 3am thoughts. All that knowledge—trapped.

Watch this."

*Show folder with tons of files*

"I built Epicenter to fix this."

## Demo 1: Whispering (30 seconds)

### The Setup
"First problem: Getting thoughts into the system."

### The Demo
*Open Whispering, start talking immediately*

"Meeting went well, need to follow up with Sarah about the API design"

*Text appears instantly*

"But here's the magic—switch to code mode."

*Click mode switcher*

"Write a function to parse JWT tokens"

*Code appears*

"Same tool. Different brain."

### The Punchline
"This was just the beginning."

## Demo 2: The Phone Magic (1 minute)

### The Setup
"Now watch what happens when I leave my desk."

*Pick up phone*

### The First Query
"What's in my workspace configs file?"

*Phone shows actual code from computer*

"That's my actual code. From my computer. On my phone."

### The Money Shot
"Add a TODO comment at the top that says 'Live demo from YC'"

*Switch to computer screen—the file changed*

"I just edited a file on my computer. From my phone. While standing here."

### The Real Use Case
*Still on phone*

"Show me everything I've written about authentication patterns"

*Results appear*

"My entire knowledge base. In my pocket."

## The Close (15 seconds)

"Everything stays on your computer. Your data, your control. But now it follows you everywhere.

This isn't about AI writing for you. It's about having a conversation with everything you've ever written.

That's Epicenter."

## Director's Notes

### Energy & Pacing
- Start talking BEFORE they expect it
- No "Hi, I'm..." Just dive in
- Keep moving. If something lags, pivot immediately
- Your energy sells this more than features

### Key Phrases That Land
- "847 markdown files" (specific number)
- "trapped" (the problem in one word)
- "Same tool. Different brain." (the aha moment)
- "From my phone. While standing here." (the magic)

### Physical Performance
- Hold phone UP when demoing (everyone needs to see)
- Point at screen changes
- Move between computer and phone smoothly
- Stand up during phone demo if possible

### What NOT to Say
- Don't explain technical details (ngrok, API keys)
- Don't mention "open source" unless asked
- Don't apologize for anything
- Don't say "let me show you" - just show

### Recovery Moves
If Whispering lags:
- "Even with network lag, still faster than typing"

If phone doesn't connect:
- Show video: "Here's what usually happens"

If nothing works:
- Tell the story: "Yesterday I was grocery shopping when I remembered..."

## The 30-Second Version
If they say "make it shorter":

"I have 847 markdown files. Trapped on my computer.

*Open Whispering*
*Speak:* "Design doc for the new API"
*Text appears*

*Pick up phone*
"What did I write about authentication?"
*Phone shows files*

*On phone:* "Add TODO: ship this"
*Computer screen updates*

My entire digital brain. Everywhere.

That's Epicenter."
