# Remove Port Field from Persistent Storage

## Objective
Remove the `port` field from persistent assistant configuration storage while keeping port generation functionality for user guidance during setup.

## Todo Items
- [x] Remove port from AssistantConfig schema (persistent storage)
- [x] Remove port from CreateAssistantParams and UpdateAssistantParams
- [x] Keep generateAvailablePort() and isPortAvailable() functions
- [x] Update CreateAssistantConfigModal to use local state for port
- [x] Remove port from EditAssistantConfigButton (no need to edit after creation)
- [x] Remove port from assistants table display
- [x] Update migration logic to drop port when migrating old configs
- [x] Update documentation to reflect port is only for initial setup
- [x] Check database schema for any port field references

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Schema Changes (assistant-configs.svelte.ts)
- Remove `port: Port` from AssistantConfig type
- Remove 'port' from CreateAssistantParams.pick()
- Keep Port type definition
- Keep generateAvailablePort() and isPortAvailable() functions

### 2. UI Changes
- **CreateAssistantConfigModal**: Keep local port state for command generation
- **EditAssistantConfigButton**: Remove port field entirely
- **AssistantTableRow**: Remove port display
- **Assistants table**: Remove port column configuration

### 3. Migration Update
- Update migration to remove port field when converting old configs

## Notes
- Port generation still helps users during initial setup
- Port is now ephemeral - only exists during assistant creation flow
- Users provide full URL which includes the port information

## Review

### Summary of Changes
1. **Removed port from persistent storage**: The `port` field has been completely removed from the `AssistantConfig` schema in both the client-side store and database schema.

2. **Preserved port generation for setup**: The `generateAvailablePort()` and `isPortAvailable()` functions remain available to help users during initial assistant setup.

3. **Updated UI components**:
   - `CreateAssistantConfigModal`: Now uses local state for port, which is only used to generate setup commands
   - `EditAssistantConfigButton`: Port field removed since it's not needed after creation
   - `AssistantTableRow` and assistants table: Port column removed from display

4. **Migration handling**: Updated to remove port fields from old configurations during migration

5. **Database schema**: Removed the `port` column from the `assistant_config` table

6. **Documentation**: Updated to reflect that port configuration is now part of the URL

### Key Benefits
- Simplified data model - no redundant port storage
- URLs are the single source of truth for connection information
- Port generation still assists users during setup without persisting unnecessary data
- Cleaner UI with fewer fields to manage
