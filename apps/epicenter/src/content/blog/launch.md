**epicenter: software for the polymath.**
a shared workspace for everything you think, write, and build.

epicenter is a growing suite of local-first tools built around a single idea:
**creativity happens at the intersection of disciplines.**
your tools should reflect that.

whether you’re transcribing an idea, writing code, taking notes, or planning your day, everything should live in one folder, in open formats, connected by a shared context layer.
no silos. no walled gardens. no data traps.

just one continuous thread of thought: across mediums, apps, and models.

### what’s here now

**📝 whispering**
a fast, minimal transcription tool that runs locally, supports whisper and other models, and exports to clean markdown. no cloud. no lock-in. just your voice, made text.

**💻 epicenter.sh**
talk to your codebase using natural language — from anywhere, without giving it away.
it spins up a local OpenCode instance, tunnels it via Cloudflare (or your own tunnel), and lets you securely query your repo. your code, your machine, your terms.

### what we’re building

epicenter is not “an app.”
it’s a **shared memory layer** — a local workspace where all your tools operate on the same context: your transcripts, your tasks, your emails, your notes, your code.

apps are modular. context is portable.
you don’t copy/paste between apps-you *move through ideas*.

we’re not chasing AI hype. we’re building tools that support **intentional, interdisciplinary thinking** — software for people who read, write, build, observe, and connect.

a renaissance workflow, built on plain text and real ownership.

### get started

* whispering: [github.com/epicenter-dev/whispering](https://github.com/epicenter-dev/whispering)
* epicenter.sh: [github.com/epicenter-dev/epicenter.sh](https://github.com/epicenter-dev/epicenter.sh)

we’re early. but if you think like a generalist, build like a hacker, and value tools that respect your mind — you might feel at home here.

issues, bugs, feedback — all welcome.


in a world where every app wants to trap you, hoard your context, and lock you in, we’re taking the opposite approach

whether you’re transcribing a lecture, writing an article, debugging your code, or planning your life, your tools should work with you — not own you. that’s why we’re building an ecosystem of lightweight apps: text editors, todo lists, email clients, creative assistants — all powered by a shared foundation of local data, open protocols, and extendable interfaces.

## Launching Epicenter — Your Personal AI OS, Starting with Whispering and OpenCode


cross polination
Hey everyone,

we're building epicenter—a growing suite of tools designed around a simple principle: you own your data, use any model you want, and you choose how to use it.

in a world where every app wants to trap you, hoard your context, and lock you in, we’re taking the opposite approach. epicenter is your personal suite of apps—one where everything runs locally, works offline, and connects to whatever AI models you want. no accounts. no clouds. no middlemen. just software you control.


We’re building **Epicenter**, a personal AI workspace where *you own your data, choose your models,* and can gradually replace every siloed app in your life with open, interoperable alternatives.

Our mission is simple: **put you at the center of your digital ecosystem** — not some API key, vendor, or closed model. Whether it’s transcription, code, writing, or planning your life, Epicenter keeps your context portable and model-agnostic. You can take it anywhere, use it with any model, and remix it however you want.

We’re starting with two apps:

### 🗣 Whispering — Transcription, Done Right

Whispering is a minimal, privacy-first transcription app built on top of OpenAI’s Whisper. Local or cloud transcription, your choice. Fast, accurate, no lock-in. Export to markdown, share snippets, and own the text.

Whispering is a fast, privacy-respecting transcription app that supports multiple models — including Whisper and other local or cloud-based backends.
You can transcribe audio, export to markdown, and fully own the text. There’s no lock-in, and no hidden pipelines. It’s just clean, usable transcription — how it should be.

### 💻 Epicenter.sh — Talk to Code on Your Own Terms

Epicenter.sh lets you spin up a local [OpenCode](https://github.com/epicenterlabs/opencode) instance and talk to it using natural language. We tunnel your self-hosted environment via Cloudflare Tunnels, so you can chat with your codebase securely from anywhere. No vendor lock-in. It’s your code, your compute.


Epicenter.sh lets you spin up a self-hosted [OpenCode](https://github.com/epicenterlabs/opencode) instance and chat with your codebase using natural language. It tunnels securely via Cloudflare, so you can access it from anywhere — without giving up control.

Prefer your own tunneling provider? No problem — you can self-host the URL and endpoint as well.

But those are just the starting points.

What we’re really building is an **ecosystem of open-source, AI-native tools** — text editors, to-do apps, email clients, creative assistants — all with a shared foundation:

* **Your data lives on your device**
* **You can use any AI model (local or cloud)**
* **Apps are modular and talk to each other**
* Context is portable and consistent across tools
* **Context is composable and persistent**

We believe in a future where **personal context is a superpower** — not a product someone sells back to you. In the age of AGI, *sharing consistent context across tools* is incredibly powerful. Rather than splitting your attention between apps, you unify it. Imagine curating a lifetime of ideas, notes, code, and memories — and asking *any* model to help you make sense of it all.

We think the next generation of tools aren’t apps — they’re **interfaces into your own knowledge**, and that interface should be open, ownable, and extendable.

We're just getting started. If you want to build a world where people don’t need to trade their autonomy for convenience, we’d love your thoughts and feedback.

Would love to hear what you think,
- Braden

Own your data. Use any model. Free and open source ❤️


Epicenter is your AI workspace — model-agnostic, privacy-first, and yours.

**launching epicenter**
a local-first workspace for people who want to own their tools — and their context.

we’re building epicenter — a growing suite of apps where **everything runs locally, works offline, and shares one unified context that *you* control.**

the idea’s simple:
all your transcripts, notes, tasks, emails, and code — in one folder, in plain text, ready to be used across whatever models or tools you prefer.

you shouldn’t need a dozen SaaS accounts and syncing hacks just to get your ideas from one place to another.
you shouldn’t have to trade privacy for functionality.
you shouldn’t lose your digital memory every time you switch tools.

### what exists right now

**📝 whispering**
a fast, minimal transcription app that runs locally and exports clean markdown.
it supports whisper and other STT models. no lock-in, no tracking, no cloud. just your words, transcribed — and ready to be used however you want.

**💻 epicenter.sh**
talk to your codebase from anywhere — without giving it to anyone else.
epicenter.sh spins up a local OpenCode instance, connects it via Cloudflare tunnels (or your own), and lets you chat with your repo securely.
your code stays local. your compute stays local. your workflow stays yours.

### what we’re building toward

this is just the start.
the long-term vision is a **portable, model-agnostic memory layer** — a local knowledge graph, built from your actual digital life: the things you say, write, code, and organize.

apps sit on top — a text editor, a task list, an email client, maybe even an assistant.
but underneath, it’s one simple idea:
**everything in one place. everything under your control. everything model-agnostic.**

this is how we bring context back into our tools.
not by centralizing it on someone else's server — but by making it local, open, and composable.

if you care about interoperability, longevity, and actually owning your digital mind — this is for you.

### try it

* whispering: [github.com/epicenter-dev/whispering](https://github.com/epicenter-dev/whispering)
* epicenter.sh: [github.com/epicenter-dev/epicenter.sh](https://github.com/epicenter-dev/epicenter.sh)

we're early. there's a lot left to build.
but the foundation’s real — and we’re building it in public.

come fork, break, extend.
send issues. file bugs. start thinking in folders again.
