## Launching Epicenter ‚Äî Your Personal AI OS, Starting with Whispering and OpenCode

Hey everyone,

we're building epicenter‚Äîa growing suite of tools designed around a simple principle: you own your data, and you choose how to use it.

in a world where every app wants to trap you, hoard your context, and lock you in, we‚Äôre taking the opposite approach. epicenter is your personal operating system ‚Äî one where everything runs locally, works offline, and connects to whatever AI models you want. no accounts. no clouds. no middlemen. just software you control.


We‚Äôre building **Epicenter**, a personal AI operating system where *you own your data, choose your models,* and can gradually replace every siloed app in your life with open, interoperable alternatives.

Our mission is simple: **put you at the center of your digital ecosystem** ‚Äî not some API key, vendor, or closed model. Whether it‚Äôs transcription, code, writing, or planning your life, Epicenter keeps your context portable and model-agnostic. You can take it anywhere, use it with any model, and remix it however you want.

We‚Äôre starting with two apps:

### üó£ Whispering ‚Äî Transcription, Done Right

Whispering is a minimal, privacy-first transcription app built on top of OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper. Local or cloud transcription, your choice. Fast, accurate, no lock-in. Export to markdown, share snippets, and own the text.

Whispering is a fast, privacy-respecting transcription app that supports multiple models ‚Äî including Whisper and other local or cloud-based backends.
You can transcribe audio, export to markdown, and fully own the text. There‚Äôs no lock-in, and no hidden pipelines. It‚Äôs just clean, usable transcription ‚Äî how it should be.

### üíª Epicenter.sh ‚Äî Talk to Code on Your Own Terms

Epicenter.sh lets you spin up a local [OpenCode](https://github.com/epicenterlabs/opencode) instance and talk to it using natural language. We tunnel your self-hosted environment via Cloudflare Tunnels, so you can chat with your codebase securely from anywhere. No vendor lock-in. It‚Äôs your code, your compute.

Prefer your own tunneling provider? No problem ‚Äî you can self-host the URL and endpoint as well.

But those are just the starting points.

What we‚Äôre really building is an **ecosystem of open-source, AI-native tools** ‚Äî text editors, to-do apps, email clients, creative assistants ‚Äî all with a shared foundation:

* **Your data lives on your device**
* **You can use any AI model (local or cloud)**
* **Apps are modular and talk to each other**
* Context is portable and consistent across tools
* **Context is composable and persistent**

We believe in a future where **personal context is a superpower** ‚Äî not a product someone sells back to you. In the age of AGI, *sharing consistent context across tools* is incredibly powerful. Rather than splitting your attention between apps, you unify it. Imagine curating a lifetime of ideas, notes, code, and memories ‚Äî and asking *any* model to help you make sense of it all.

We think the next generation of tools aren‚Äôt apps ‚Äî they‚Äôre **interfaces into your own knowledge**, and that interface should be open, ownable, and extendable.

We're just getting started. If you want to build a world where people don‚Äôt need to trade their autonomy for convenience, we‚Äôd love your thoughts and feedback.
